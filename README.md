
In C, implement an in-place sorting algorithm where you use quicksort while partitions are more than 10 elements long and insertion sort for anything less. Assume you have an array and a length passed in as inputs to your functions. Comment on potential limitations or failure modes of your algorithm.
Assume the function definition is
`void sort(int* arr_ptr, int arr_sz);`
where `arr_ptr is` a pointer to the first element of an `arr_sz` length array
